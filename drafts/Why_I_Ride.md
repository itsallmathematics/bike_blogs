# Why I Ride - My Bicycle Riding Philosophies

I often am asked the question:

> What type of riding do you do?

This will come up when shopping for a new bike or bike parts, meeting another cyclist, etc... After thinking about it, I realized that I had a somewhat proprietary and unique take on my cycling and wanted to jot it down. In this post, I will introduce my reasons for riding bicycles and then also talk about my current configuration and why it meets my needs.

## Priority Order

I realized that I have several goals in my cycling, and while these priorities are not static, the below list sums up the generalized order:

1. I ride for fitness - Cardiovascular health and calorie expenditure
2. I ride for fresh air - breathing fresh outdoor air
3. I ride for exploration - discovering the world around me
4. I ride for speed - enjoying periodic bursts of speed and adrenaline

When I got into cycling at first, I was looking for a lower-impact (compared with running) form of cardiovascular exercise I could do outdoors.

## My Bicycle Triangle

I've come up with an idea that I'll call my "bicycle triangle" and there are 3 components [insert]:

1. Safety - If I get injured or killed, I won't be able to ride any more
2. Technique - Focusing on and improving my cornering, sprinting, climbing, descending, handling, etc...
3. Heart rate - Ensuring that my cardiovascular system is actually being challenged when I want it to be

These 3 points on the triangle are generally what I am focused on when I am actually riding each day, and they influence decisions that I make when I choose rides.

## Why Outdoors?
Because cardio workouts in the gyms around here are absolutely miserable to me for the following reasons:

1. The gyms have 10-15 large TVs placed in front of the patron, forcing them to watch CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc... When I work out, the absolute last thing I want to be doing is watching TV.
2. Doing long bouts of cardio without moving or exploring makes it feel 10x longer and much less appealing
3. Sweat. Without the breeze, I get drenched in sweat which is uncomfortable at the very least, and damaging to bike components at most.
4. Fresh air - working indoors all of the time in the last few years, I've learned just how important "fresh air" is. It's not just some gimmick - my brain will literally function at a lower capacity when it does not receive periodic fresh air throughout the day from out doors.
5. Sun - The sun light and exposure physically/chemically makes my body feel so much better and clears my mind, similar to fresh air.

## Equipment

I've found, to my initial surprise, that the bike I spend the most time on is a "gravel bike" called the Giant Revolt Advanced 3, for the following reasons:

1. It has wide handlebars and flared drops - this is more comfortable and makes me feel like I have more control over the bike
2. It has a shock-absorbing seat post and handlebars, and it is fully carbon fiber composite - CF doesn't conduct heat well which is nice on hot days
3. It's still very capable on road - even with 44C WTB Raddlers on it. I've brought it to 36MPH so far.
4. Despite #3, it's generally much more difficult to achieve and maintain a given speed on road compared to my road bike.

You may look at #4 and be puzzled as to why I am listing this as a "pro" rather than a "con" of my gravel bike. Well, for this we need to revisit my primary reason for riding: fitness. In fact, speed is quite far down my list (though not completely off the list). From what I've discovered in my journey so far, unlike me, many road cyclists put speed on the ultimate pedestal, hence the reason why lighter components are seen are more premium and generally cost far more. However, if fitness rather than speed is the main goal, several things change.

First, I made the realization that I actually *do not* want to be travelling too fast for too long on the majority of my rides. As aforementioned, my main concerns are fitness and being outside in the fresh air. This does not necessarily require travelling 40 miles away from the start of my rides, and since I often ride close on the calendar to other obligations, I'd rather stay somewhat near my starting point in case something were to go wrong and I have to walk my bike back, get help, etc...

I also generally do not like traffic and I try to avoid it as much as possible. According to the NHSTA's website, busy streets are where 70% of bike accidents occur where cars hit a bicyclist. By simply avoiding busy streets and staying off of high speed roads, you drastically improve your chances of avoiding accidents. In the area I ride, the farther I go, the more likely I am to have to get onto busier and higher speed roads.

Next, on a bike with thicker tires like my gravel bike, I can feel a large difference in rolling resistance, and I have to output more power to get the bike to go over the same terrain at the same speed as my road bike. This means that generally, all other things constant, I am getting a better workout at a lower speed on my gravel bike, which is preferable to me.

However, this decision is subject to potential change. One thing is that my gravel bike is a significantly higher-end bike than my current road bike, and it is also more properly fit to me size-wise. So there's a decent chance that when I upgrade my road bike, it will feel at least as good as my gravel bike and I will put more miles on it as well, especially when it's not rush hour or on quiet backroads. I actually do enjoy riding on roads sometimes more than dirt because roads are limited by regulation on what type of grades they can employ, plus, they tend to facilitate more consistent pedalling for longer periods of times which can help me burn more calories over a given workout, or at least it seems so.

Finally, I'd like to mention that although I am not looking to race any time soon, that doesn't mean I enjoy an absurdly heavy bike either. A light bike has advantages when climbing, transporting, having to walk it, etc... But, what I've found is that the lower end mainstream components (such as the Shimano GRX-400 on my gravel bike) still offer a decent ride and there is relatively diminishing returns the higher-end I go, unless I'm racing. I'd rather just drop a few pounds of fat off my body than worry about 200 grams of componentry for my riding. The benefit to this is that I can save some money by getting high quality components but just not the lightest ones.

### Not what I expected
This has been interesting because from just reading online and watching videos, it seememed that I would probably be spending all my time on a road bike initially. However, when I actually did that for about 5 months straight, I realized that there are tons of unexplored dirt and gravel trails around my area, combined with the desire to get out of vehicle traffic sometimes (more on that later), and I actually would rather just take out the gravel bike because it's good for riding on paved roads, gravel roads, dirt roads, and even over brush and other types of obstructions. This results in me exploring and learning more places to ride almost every ride, and it allows me to ride much farther from traffic because many roads have some sort of dirt shoulder I can ride on instead. But hey, I'll take it!


### Tires

I chose very aggressive off-road gravel tires called WTB Raddlers in 700x44C because I can still ride them on road, and remember my goal is fitness, so going slower and working harder actually support my primary riding goal, unlike for example a bicycle racer. Climbing also supports that goal. My thought process is: It's easier to ride off-road tires on-road for me than it is to ride on-road tires on dirt, mud, sand, rocks, etc... So therefore, I would rather have the off-road tires on my gravel bike.

### Lights

I use Bontrager ION PRO RT and FLARE RT lights on front/rear respectively. I have mounts for each bike with quick release, to easily switch between them. I consider my lights a very important safety component and therefore ensuring the lights are properly charged and ready for use at all times is one of my top priorities. I do not use the lights on trails where there are no cars, but any time I am riding on a street where cars may be present, the lights are on and flashing.

### Horn

I carry a very small but extremely loud horn on my bike when I ride, which is called the Hornit. It outputs max 140dB. This developed after I was almost hit somewhere in the order of 5-7 times over the course of last Summer. I rarely use the horn, but they are legally required in some jurisdictions, and for a great reason - they can get the attention of drivers in a last ditch attempt to prevent an accident. If a 4000lb moving piece of metal is required to have a horn on the road, why wouldn't you want one? It's mostly good for warning folks who may be pulling out in front of you but not looking your direction at the time.

In general, I've found that many folks miseuse horns. Horns are often used as what I would describe as "cry baby devices" that other grown adults use to let others know that they were irritated or annoyed by their actions. However, this is not the purpose of horns. The main purpose for a horn is to draw the attention of an otherwise oblivious driver in order to prevent imminent injury or death. In fact, many states actually have this written in the vehicle law itself.

### Transportation

I don't use a fancy rack, I just strap the bike into my pickup truck in a very similar way that people who use those tailgate pads do - but instead of a tailgate pad I use bungees and a blanket. Why? Because at any given time I am only transporting 1 bike, I can secure it properly using this method, it's free, and using a blanket rather than a pad prevents a pad from sitting on my truck's paint job for long periods, trapping moisture and accumulating dirt, etc...
